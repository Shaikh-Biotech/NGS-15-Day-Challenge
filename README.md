# Day 1: NGS Fundamentals
## Overview
Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a technology that allows us to rapidly sequence large base pairs of DNA and RNA fragments simultaneously.
It is also known as massively parallel sequencing.
## Key Concepts
* **Massively Parallel:** Running millions of reactions at once.
* **Throughput:** The amount of sequencing data produced in a single run.
* **Library Prep:** The process of preparing DNA/RNA samples for the sequencer.

## Sanger vs. NGS
| Feature | Sanger | NGS |
|---------|--------|-----|
| Scaling | Single-plex | Massively Parallel |
| Cost | High per base | Low per base |
| Application | Small scale/Validation | Discovery/Whole Genome |

## Evolution
1. **1st Gen:** Sanger (Chain termination)
2. **2nd Gen:** Illumina (Sequencing by Synthesis)
3. **3rd Gen:** Nanopore/PacBio (Long-read single molecule)
